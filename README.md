# The-Effect-of-Sparse-Coding-visualized-in-Application
Compares the performance of classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF), where we use an overcomplete dictionary in the second algorithm. By enforcing different levels of sparsity in the activation matrix of the NNMF algorithm, it can be shown that sparse coding can increase performance for denoising and compression of pictures.
